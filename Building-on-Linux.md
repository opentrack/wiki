Opentrack does not provide binaries for Linux users. The following is a brief attempt at the missing guide on compiling Opentrack for Linux.

## Building on Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

## 1. Install Dependencies

The following dependencies are required in order to build Opentrack. First:

```sh
sudo apt update
```

Then:

### On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libopencv-dev libproc2-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-tools-dev wine64-tools
```

### On Arch/Manjaro

```sh
sudo pacman -S cmake git opencv procps-ng qt6-base qt6-tools
```

### On Fedora:

```sh
dnf install cmake git opencv-devel procps-ng-devel qt5-linguist qt5-qtbase-private-devel qt6-qtbase-private-devel qt6-qttools-devel
```

Users of other distributions are encouraged to expand upon this guide.

## 2. Optional dependencies

You'll also need to install the following optional dependencies:

Debian/Ubuntu  | Arch/Manjaro | Fedora | Description
---------------|--------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------
`wine64-tools` | ???          | `wine-devel` | Needed to set SDK_WINE=ON config, as described below.
???            | ???          | `onnxruntime-devel` | Needed to build the neuralnet tracker.

(i.e. repeat the apt/pacman/dnf command from above, with the optional dependencies
you need appended to the end.)

## 3. Clone the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack
cd opentrack/
```

## 4. Configure

Set configuration options, as for any cmake project. To run Opentrack on
Linux, you'll probably want to set `SDK_WINE=ON`, i.e:

```sh
cmake . -DSDK_WINE:BOOL=ON
```

Alternatively, use '`ccmake .`' to view an interactive list of available configuration variables. When done, press `c` to reconfigure, `e` to dismiss the resulting dialog, and then `g` to generate the configuration.


## 5. Compile

```sh
make -j$(nprocs)
```

The `-j` arg does the compilation in parallel across all your CPUs, so speeds
things up tremendously.

## 6. Install

```sh
make -j$(nprocs) install
```

This installs to wherever the config variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` points to,
by default just `./install`.

## 7. Run

Change to the install's bin directory and try it out:

```
cd install/bin
./opentrack
```

## 8. Variations

You might want to change the directory we install Opentrack to, in which case
modify the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` configuration, e.g:

```sh
cmake . -DSDK_WINE:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/.local
```

To enable the neuralnet tracker also add the ONNXRuntime cmake and include dirs, for example `-DONNXRuntime_DIR=/usr/lib64/cmake/onnxruntime -DONNXRuntime_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/onnxruntime`

and then recompile, etc.
